    "description": "This novel takes place sometime after the battle of Endor (Episode VI) and before the battle of Jakku. It follows a rag-tag group (but the author is good enough to never refers to the group as rag-tag (show don't tell; y'all)) that comes together for the purpose of bringing down a Tie Fighter squad known as Shadow Wing. This novel ties in with the Tie Fighter comics.",
