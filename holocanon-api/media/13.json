    "description": "The first movie of the third trilogy of the main movie saga which is the seventh movie made but...also the seventh movie in the series. Oh hey, they finally made the episode numbers line up. Anyways, this is the first movie after Disney acquired the Star Wars franchise. Rey, Finn, Poe, and the Resistance are the heroes. Kylo Ren, Hux, Phasma, Snoke, and the First Order are the bad guys. How did the First Order acquire so much power under the New Republic's nose in the thirty years since the end of Episode VI? Where did they get all their funding? I don't know, Helen.",
